Note: NemosMiner will automatically update existing config files during updates. Changed config items will get renamed / removed or converted as needed.
It is recommended to review the updated configuration after an update.

NiceHash pool Config:
=====================
- Added 'IsInternal' flag (lower fee of 2% instad of 5%), see .\Config.PoolsConfig-NiceHashInternal.json for an example
