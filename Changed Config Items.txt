  "GPUCount": 1, obsolete
  "HideConsole": false, obsolete
  "MarginOfError": 0,4, obsolete
  "MinDataSampleAlgoMultiplier": obsolete, use miner warmuptimes instead
  "PoolsConfigFile": "", obsolete. PoolsConfig moved to normal config file
  "SelGPUDSTM": "0 1", obsolete; replaced with per device configuration option "ExcludeDeviceName"
  "SelGPUCC": "0,1", obsolete; replaced with per device configuration option "ExcludeDeviceName"
  "SSL": not supported until a later release
  "Type": ["AMD", "CPU", "NVIDIA"],  obsolete; replaced with per device configuration option "ExcludeDeviceName"
  "TypeAMD": true, obsolete; replaced with per device configuration option "ExcludeDeviceName"
